## Compiling
Make sure you have gcc, g++, openGL, GLU and GLUT installed. For instance, on Lubuntu,
```shell
sudo apt-get install g++ freeglut3-dev

You also need libpng for the lab10 version of the project:
```shell
sudo apt-get install libpng++-dev
```

To compile, just run
```shell
cd src/
make
```
## Running
To run Micro Machines:
```shell
make run
```
